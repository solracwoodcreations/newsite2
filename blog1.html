    It's true I could no longer do the construction work and pool cleaning jobs that I used to do, but that’s not why I started making <strong>wood projects</strong>. After my accident, I spent almost a year in the hospital and another half a year in a wheelchair. I had <strong>broken my pelvis</strong>, which was fixed with five screws holding it together, and also <strong>crushed my T12 vertebrae</strong> to dust, which was repaired through a <strong>back fusion operation</strong>.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Between my pelvis operation and my back fusion, due to the fact that I had <strong>collapsed one of my lungs</strong> during the accident, they cut me through the side of my body instead of cutting me through the back — resulting in a total of <strong>65 staples</strong>, not stitches but big, ugly, giant staples. I looked like a human zipper. Anyways, that’s a story for another time. This is a story of a little <strong>wooden paper towel holder</strong>.
    It was during this process of healing — after being broken and put back together — that I started noticing <em>old, broken, and discarded pieces of wood</em>. I remember thinking, if I could be put back together and fixed, surely I could repurpose some of this wood.

    The first thing I made while still going to physical therapy and learning to walk again was a <strong>paper towel holder</strong>, which I kept hearing my mother say she needed. I made it out of a <strong>broken piece of bed frame</strong>. I took out the staples and nails, cut out the pieces that I needed, and gave it new life. 
    I left the staple scars visible and painted it with a <strong>warm walnut stain</strong> and a <strong>glossy finish</strong> to match the table and chairs I had. I thought it was the most beautiful wooden paper towel holder — even though you could still see the staple scars and nail holes. I was very proud of my little creation.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    I wasn’t trying to make the best paper towel holder in the world. I was simply trying to give this <em>piece of broken bed frame another chance at life</em>. Maybe that sounds strange, but after what I had been through, I understood what it meant to be broken and rebuilt. Perhaps that’s why I felt such a strong connection to that old piece of wood — I wanted it to feel useful again, just like I did.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Now, ten years and many <strong>wood projects</strong> later, I still feel a connection with that little paper towel holder. Every time I look at it, I see myself — with its staple scars, its repaired pieces, and its second chance at life. <strong>Repurposed and reborn</strong>, it reminds me of resilience, patience, and the beauty of giving something broken a purpose again. It has brought me <em>peace and joy</em>. I know that sounds corny, but it’s true — and I’ve been building things with as much <strong>refurbished wood</strong> as I can find ever since.
