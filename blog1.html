    <h2>How to Build a Personal Brand as a Developer</h2>
    <p>It's true I could no longer do the construction work and pool cleaning jobs that I used to do, but that’s not why I started making <strong>wood projects</strong>. After my accident, I spent almost a year in the hospital and another half a year in a wheelchair.
