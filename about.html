    <h2 class="no-accent">Hi, I’m [Your Name].</h2>
    <p>
        I’m the founder and sole artisan behind Opal Grain. Every piece you see here is
        designed, crafted, and finished by my hands.

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section id="introduction">
            <p>
                At <strong>Opal Grain</strong>, every creation is a testament to artistry, care, and individuality. 
                I transform reclaimed and donated hardwoods into functional, elegant pieces that are as purposeful 
                as they are beautiful. Each design is born from my hands, my imagination, and a lifetime of creative exploration.

        <!-- Early Inspiration -->
        <section id="early-inspiration">
            <h2>Where It Began</h2>
            <p>
                My love for design began in childhood. In second grade, I entered a school project contest using glued toothpicks. 
                While most children created flat designs, I built mine in three dimensions. That piece earned 
                <strong>2nd place at the New Mexico State Fair</strong>, hinting at a lifelong path of innovation and creativity.

        <!-- Craftsmanship Journey -->
        <section id="craftsmanship">
            <h2>The Craftsmanship Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Woodworking became a passion in middle school. I learned to shape, carve, and bring ideas to life, 
                and my teachers quickly recognized a natural affinity with tools and materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an adult, I honed precision, problem-solving, and craftsmanship in the construction industry — 
                metal framing, drywall, and painting — learning skills that would later define my approach to woodwork.
            </p>

        <!-- Resilience Story -->
        <section id="resilience">
            <h2>Resilience & Return</h2>
            <p>
                A life-altering car accident could have ended my hands-on journey. Doctors said I might never walk again. 
                Against all odds, I returned to movement, and with it, the craft I love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, every piece I create is designed, carved, and finished by me — no assembly lines, 
                no factories, just one artist bringing ideas to life.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Creations -->
        <section id="creations">
            <h2>What I Create</h2>
            <p>
                From wall-mounted coffee stations to innovative multipurpose bag clips, key holders, travel trays, 
                candleholders, and phone stands, each creation blends function with refined design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I invent solutions that are elegant, practical, and entirely unique — like my patented bag clips 
                that work on any bag, not just chips.
            </p>

        <!-- Digital Craft -->
        <section id="digital-craft">
            <h2>Beyond Wood</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond wood, I have taught myself the digital craft: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                I built this website from scratch using only my iPhone XR and GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
                Opal Grain represents the intersection of lifelong creativity, resilience, and skill — 
                a brand where every object tells a story, and every story begins with my hands.
            </p>
